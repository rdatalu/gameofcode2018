# Rdata.lu's contribution to the Game of Code 2018 - Open Data Challenge

We used various data sets, most from the [Open data portal](https://data.public.lu)
to build a Shiny web application. The app helps you make your commute smarter
by telling you which bus lines, public bikes, public cars and more you can use.

You can run the app here:

You can also run the app locally by running the ... script in the /app
folder.

The /code folder contains a bunch of R functions that download/update
the data. A lot of the data used is download into the /data folder. This
might seem archaic compared to using relevant apis, but there are
good reasons to it this way: first, there is no api for bus lines;
instead, the Verk√©iersverbond publishes [GTFS files](https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/gtfs/).
There is an api for real time access to the buses and stops. However,
there seems to be a daily limit (as per the comments [here](https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/arrets-de-transport-public-et-departs-en-temps-reel/#_)).
This is why we decided to use the GTFS files for the bus.

For the public bicycles, we use the real time api to know if bikes are
available for a given station, but we also have downloaded the gps
coordinates of the bike stations. This makes it easier to put them
on a map and draw paths between them.

For carloh, we downloaded the stations. As far as we are aware, there
is no real time api for carloh yet.

Weather alerts get automatically updated every time you start the app.

The chargy api was down the day of the datathon, so we did not integrate
it to our app.
